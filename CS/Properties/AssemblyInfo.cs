// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to implement conditional formatting for rows
// 
// The following sample demonstrates how to change the appearance of grid rows
// based on some condition. For example, in this tutorial you can see that the
// background color of grid rows is gradually changed based on the value in the
// second data column.
// This is done by binding the Background property of a style,
// assigned to a row, to a color converter. This converter is represented by the
// ColorValueConverter class that implements the IValueConverter interface and
// returns a color according to the provided numerical value.
// 
// You can find sample updates and versions for different programming languages here:
